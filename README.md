# ncloud
New C++ framework for the Coursera cloud computing course

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to provide a C++-based framework
for the Coursera Cloud Computing course.

The primary focus is to provide a simple understandable framework for educational purposes. I've tried to keep the code as portable as possible.


## Code outline
There are four main sections of the code:
1. The bottom layer network interfaces (both abstract and concrete classes).
2. The intermediate plumbing (used to hold the application level code/data).
3. The top layer application code that runs the simulation.
4. Utility classes/functions


### Network interfaces
There are two main abstract interfaces: INetwork and IConnection.  INetwork is a factory that produces IConnections.  An IConnection encapsulates the idea of a network endpoint that is used for both sending and receiving.

According there are concrete classes: SimNetwork and SimConnection, that simulate the network.


### NetworkNode and protocol interfaces
The main class here is the NetworkNode. This is used to hold together all of the data that belongs to this "logical node". Thus the MP1/MP2 classes are all part of this class.

In addition, there is a new interface, the IMessageHandler.  This is what is called back when a message is received over the network.


### Application layer
This is where the main send/receive loop are driven from.  Currently, there is MP1App.cpp.

### File descriptions
* catch.hpp : a C++ unit-testing framework.
* jsoncpp.cpp : the Jsoncpp framework
* json/* : the Jsoncpp framework
* Log.* : logging implementation
* Member.* : Holds data for MP1 (the membership protocol). MP2 classes will be able to access this data through the NetworkNode.
* MP1.* : Holds the message handlers/messages for MP1
* MP2.* : Holds the message handlers/messages for MP2
* MP1App.* : Application for MP1, runs the test simulation
* MP2App.* : Application for MP2, runs the test simulation
* Network.h : Primary network interface header file
* NetworkNode.* : A node on the network. This combines the network and the data for a particular node (which allows MP2 to access MP1 data).
* Params.* : Parameter header file
* Ring.* : Holds data for MP2 (the DHT ring).
* SimNetwork.* : Implementation for a simulated network
* SparseMatrix.h : sparse matrix implementation to store statistics
* stdincludes.h
* Test*.cpp : Unit testing files
* Util.* : Utility functions

To solve MP1, the student should only need to change Member.* and MP1.*.

## Differences from the old version
1. Ports are now used in the code. In my code I have used port 6000 for the membership protocol and 6001 for the ring protocol. This will allow one machine to run different processes all taking part in the membership/ring protocol.  An assumption in the code is that the ring protocol runs at one port higher than the membership protocol.
2. The binary code has been rewritten to use binary streams.
3. The params file is now a JSON file.


## Future work
* Better documentation
* Create a version that uses sockets
* Better testing of the higher level code
