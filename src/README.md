# ncloud
New C++ framework for the Coursera cloud computing course

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to provide a C++-based framework
for the Coursera Cloud Computing course.

The primary focus is to provide a simple understandable framework for educational purposes.  Thus simplicity/understandability is preferred over efficiency


## Code outline
There are four main sections of the code:
1. The bottom layer network interfaces (both abstract and concrete classes).
2. The intermediate plumbing (used to hold the application level code/data).
3. The top layer application code that runs the simulation.
4. Utility classes/functions


### Network interfaces
There are two main abstract interfaces: INetwork and IConnection.  INetwork is a factory that produces IConnections.  An IConnection encapsulates the idea of a network endpoint that is used for both sending and receiving.

According there are concrete classes: SimNetwork and SimConnection, that simulate the network.


### NetworkNode and protocol interfaces
The main class here is the NetworkNode. This is used to hold together all of the data that belongs to this "logical node". Thus the MP1/MP2 classes are all part of this class.

In addition, there is a new interface, the IMessageHandler.  This is what is called back when a message is received over the network.


### Application layer
This is where the main send/receive loop are driven from.  Currently, there is MP1App.cpp.


## Differences from the old version
1. Ports are now used in the code. In my code I have used port 6000 for the membership protocol and 6001 for the ring protocol. This will allow one machine to run different processes all taking part in the membership/ring protocol.
2. JSON is used as for the communication protocol.
3. The params file is now a JSON file.


## Future work
* Better documentation
* Implement MP2App.cpp
* Create a version that uses sockets
* Better testing of the higher level code
